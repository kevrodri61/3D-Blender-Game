# 3D-Game-Final
This is my final 3D game for CSCI 43800

I used UPBGE to make a game about a Fish in a tank dodging red blocks. Everytime the fish gets hit,
the counter in the background goes up by 1.

Some of the biggest issues I faced was getting the physics and collisions to properly work. Having round objects, such as the fish and the "bowl, 
makes the collisions difficult to deal with. Another issue I faced with UPBGE was that when moving an objects position, it would not update on my screen 
until i hit play.
